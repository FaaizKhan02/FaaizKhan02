# 💫 About Me:
I am a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student at Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology (SZABIST ’27), specializing in Cybersecurity with a strong focus on Offensive Security, Vulnerability Research, and AI/LLM Security. My core interest lies in understanding adversarial behavior, simulating real-world attacks, and engineering defensive strategies that strengthen digital infrastructures.<br><br>I actively train in practical offensive security through platforms such as Hack The Box and TryHackMe, where I engage in real-world penetration testing scenarios involving reconnaissance, exploitation, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation techniques. These labs have strengthened my analytical thinking, attack-chain understanding, and ability to assess system weaknesses from an attacker’s perspective.<br><br>As an active Bug Hunter and Vulnerability Researcher on HackerOne, I perform web and API security testing against real applications. My assessments include identifying and validating vulnerabilities such as:<br><br>• Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)<br>• SQL Injection (SQLi)<br>• Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)<br>• Authentication & Authorization flaws<br>• Security Misconfigurations<br><br>I utilize professional tools including Burp Suite, Nmap, OWASP ZAP, and custom reconnaissance scripts to automate and enhance vulnerability discovery. I develop Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits, document technical impact, and produce structured security reports aligned with industry standards.<br><br>During my Cyber Security Internship at CodeAlpha, I contributed to phishing awareness initiatives, assisted in threat detection and incident response processes, and developed a Python-based network sniffer for packet capture and protocol analysis. This experience strengthened my understanding of real-time monitoring, traffic inspection, and network-based attack detection.<br><br>Beyond offensive security, I have hands-on experience in:<br><br>🔹 Deploying and configuring Suricata NIDS with custom detection rules<br>🔹 Automating reconnaissance workflows using Bash scripting<br>🔹 Secure coding practices and system hardening<br>🔹 Debugging multi-language full-stack applications<br>🔹 Network fundamentals and architecture analysis<br><br>My development background includes Java, C, x86 Assembly, Python, PHP/Laravel, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), MongoDB, and SQL. I have built full-stack systems, security automation scripts, and real-time monitoring solutions, combining software engineering principles with cybersecurity expertise.<br><br>Additionally, I hold certifications in OWASP Top 10 (2021 & 2025), including LLM and GenAI Security, which aligns with my growing interest in securing AI-driven systems. I am particularly motivated to explore the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity — focusing on adversarial attacks against LLMs, AI model abuse, and defensive AI security architectures.<br><br>I am continuously sharpening my skills through CTF competitions, vulnerability research, lab simulations, and real-world security analysis. My long-term objective is to evolve into a highly skilled Red Team Specialist and Cybersecurity Engineer capable of designing, attacking, and defending complex systems in modern cloud and AI environments.<br><br>I am open to internships,Jobs, research collaborations, and security-focused opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow within high-impact security teams.
